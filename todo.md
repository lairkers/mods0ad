# Ideas for further development

## Bugfixes
- Standing units
    Problem needs to be understood

## AIs / players of last group receive giant amount of treasure
Needs to identify AI players if possible. Otherwise only give treasures if at least 2 groups, then give the last group.

## Pirates / Ceasar
After a while (40 min?) pirates attack from river side. They do not have siege units, as this may be too hard
if you have all your defense in the north.
This may happen instead of Napata attacks, OR in addition to Napata. It may also happen repeatedly or only once.

Alternatively 'Caesar' attacks from left or right with Roman troops. Trigger could be to destroy one of the
random houses.

## [low prio] Timing based rebuilding city
After a trigger (time or DefCon or time after DefCon) there are rebuilding troops spawned periodically.
Goal: avoid the players to wait too long until they raid the city.

## [low prio] Apocalyptic riders upgrade
There is a stable on top of the mountain which spawns apocalyctic riders, but groups of increasing size per
player.

## [low prio] Randomizer
All of the addons may be selected at game start so that the players must find out where defense
is needed at most.
