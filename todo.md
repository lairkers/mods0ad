# Ideas for further development

## Pirates / Ceasar
After a while (40 min?) pirates attack from river side. They do not have siege units, as this may be too hard
if you have all your defense in the north.
This may happen instead of Napata attacks, OR in addition to Napata. It may also happen repeatedly or only once.

Alternatively 'Caesar' attacks from left or right with Roman troops. Trigger could be to destroy one of the
random houses.

## Turretted walls are randomized

## Rebuilding city
If a building is destroyed, a citizen (or mutiple?) are spawned to rebuild it.
To be clearified: Same location? => no, let's place the replacement anywhere on the map? That would be funny.

## [low prio] Flooding defense upgrade
Counter attack a.k.a. flooding defense is only executed after 1, 2 or 3 napata attack cycles

## [low prio] Apocalyptic riders upgrade
There is a stable on top of the mountain which spawns apocalyctic riders, but groups of increasing size per
player.

## [low prio] Randomizer
All of the addons may be selected at game start so that the players must find out where defense
is needed at most.

## [minor] [discarded] Patroling ships
Small upgrade to guard the river. Alternatively the ships are further away from the coast to allow
building of a harbour but prevent trade.

## [discarded] 10 Plagues
This may be one of the following list.
1. Blood == Cannot drink water for 7 days   -> No fish
2. Frogs: ??        -> Spawns chicken around civic centres (not really a harm)
                        Alternatively: translate to "high water" which destroys your harbour.
3./4. Mosquitos     -> All units get small damage
5. Animal disease   -> Kills some of your riders + Elephants (+ ??)
6. General disease  -> Kills some of your units
7. Hagel == Kills men, animals, destroys fields -> Kills / hurts some of your units, destroys fields
8. Grasshoppers     -> Destroys fields / fields need to be reerected
9. Darkness         -> Can I change the lighting?? Would not really be a harm
10. Death to all firstborn  -> Kills some of your units? Only females? Only non-graduated? Only units which are
                                build within the last 3 minutes (possible?)
More ideas:
- Steal all / half of your food / wood (very mean!) or iron (possibility)
- Kill elephants in the desert
It may happen after a while but repeatedly. Needs to be balanced properly otherwise it is not cool just annoying.
Because you cannot do anything against it.
